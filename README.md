## Caveat
This project has been evolving for the better part of the last decade.  It has morphed, not always cleanly 
and with no design document as a guide, based upon my needs for any arbitrary lab assignment I gave my students.
Bottom line, it's a bit of a mess but it's time to put it out there.

# Java Testing Framework

## Background
I used JUnit to test the correctness of the results of my students' code.  While a very useful tool in industry,
students such as mine (I primarily teach foundation-level courses: CS1, CS2, Data Structures) do not have the
experience or insights to effectively use the results of those tests.  These tests also tend to be at a high level,
only testing accessible/visible methods; they do not exercise private methods and they require that the entire
implementation be in-place.  Generally not a problem for CS1.  Learning object-oriented programming in CS2
introduces new challenges for the students and the tests - properly structured objects can't be interrogated by
external code due to encapsulation/visibility constraints.
